# Software Design Specification (SDS)

## Project name
Thane of Combat

## Version
v1.0 â€“ Initial system design (covers all planned features across sprints)

## Overview
*Thane of Combat* is a command-line game built in Python in which the Player fights enemies, gaining xp and levelling up with their victories. It is developed using object-oriented design and an agile workflow. The app is built incrementally over several sprints, each delivering a functional stage of development. Features include creating a player with stats, managing them in memory, selecting level-appropriate enemies to fight, the player gaining xp for defeating enemies, and levelling up where they can increase their stats.

The system design outlined here covers the full project scope, even though features will be implemented gradually over time.

## System architecture
The system consists of two main classes:

- `Player`: Represents the Player character with attributes such as health, damage, level, and xp.
- `Enemy`: For creating different types of enemies and assigning them similar attributes to the Player so that the Player can engage in text-based combat.

The program is designed for terminal-based use and avoids GUI dependencies. Each sprint builds on the existing functionality.

## Class descriptions

### Player

| Attribute       | Type     | Description                                 |
|----------------|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| `name`        | `str`    | The Player's name             |
| `strength`     | `int`    | The Player's damage they are able to deal when they `attack()`     |
| `wisdom`  | `int`   | How much the Player is able to heal when they `rest()`  |
| `current_health`  | `int`    | The Player's remaining health            |
| `max_health`  | `int`    | The Player's maximum health capacity      |
| `level`  | `int`   | The Player's level, indicating their progress in the game  |
| `xp`  | `int`   | How close the player is to levelling up  |


| Method              | Description                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `attack(target)`   | Reduces `Enemy.health` by `strength`               |
| `rest()` | Increases `Player.health` by `wisdom`              |
| `display_stats()` | Prints the `Player` object's statistics   |
| `level_up()` | Allows the Player to increase one of their attributes     |
| `death()` | When the Player's `health` reaches 0 they die    |

### Enemy

| Attribute | Type        | Description                                |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `name`        | `str`    | The Enemy's name             |
| `strength`     | `int`    | The Enemy''s damage they are able to deal when they `attack()`     |
| `current_health`  | `int`    | The Enemy's remaining health            |
| `max_health`  | `int`    | The Enemy's maximum health capacity      |
| `difficulty`  | `int`   | To determine at what `Player level` this enemy should be fought  |

| Method                    | Description                                         |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `attack(target)`      | Reduces `Player.health` by `strength`                      |
| `death(xp_receiver)`     | When the Enemy's `current_health` reaches 0, the Player receives xp related to the enemy's `difficulty`   |


## Assumptions and constraints
- The application runs in a command-line interface (CLI) only.
- All data is stored in memory initially; persistence will be added in later sprints.
- Python 3 standard library and minimal external dependencies (`os`, `random`).

## Planned features by sprint

**Sprint 1**
- Task and TaskManager classes created
- Instantiate different enemies with relevant attributes
- Display Player stats and full details
- Pseudo-randomly select an enemy to fight

**Sprint 2**
- Filter possible enemies to fight by their difficulty
- Implement Player levelling-up capability with stat increase
- Add xp gain for when the Player defeats an enemy
- Enhance user feedback and validation

**Sprint 3**
- Optional: Add `critical_chance` for enemy attacks
- Extend user interface with command menus
- Add automated tests for core functionality
- Final documentation and polish

## Extensibility
The design supports easy addition of new features. Possibly a new class for `Items` such as potions that could be stored in an `inventory` for the `Player` class. Attributes such as `critical_chance`, `dodge_chance`, or `droppable_loot` can be added to the `Enemy` class. More advanced user interface options or external file formats (e.g. CSV, JSON) can be implemented with minimal disruption to the system architecture - especially to add data persistence in storing the `Player` statistics.
